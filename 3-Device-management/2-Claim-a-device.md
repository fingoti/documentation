There's more than one way to claim. The most convenient method is to use the Fingoti app.

- Install the app
    - From [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fingoti.flutter_onboarding_v1&gl=GB) {% infoHover %}Requires Android 5.0 and up.{% /infoHover %}
    - From the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/fingoti/id1607527763) {% infoHover %}Requires iOS 13.0 or later.{% /infoHover %}
- Follow [these instructions](3-Device-management/1-Methods-to-claim-a-device/1-Claim-with-the-app.md)

If you have an Evaluation Board, or USB to Serial Adapter Board, you can [claim using UART](3-Device-management/1-Methods-to-claim-a-device/2-Claim-with-UART.md).

Finally, [using a browser over the local network](3-Device-management/1-Methods-to-claim-a-device/3-Claim-with-the-browser.md).
