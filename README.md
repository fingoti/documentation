Welcome to the documentation for everything Fingoti.

Our tutorials can be read one at a time, or from beginning to end. We provide a prerequisites list for each guide. For example, [Enable multi-factor authentication](1-Account-management/Enable-multi-factor-authentication.md).

This menu outlines actions that must be taken before reading the current page, in this case:

- Creating an account
- Installing an authenticator app
